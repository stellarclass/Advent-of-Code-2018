# Advent of Code 2018

I have to learn Python not only for the Machine Learning Certificate I'm doing at York University, but because it's pretty useful in other aspects of my life (up to and including improving career prospects!). A friend (hi @DanaL!) sent over [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) and it is the perfect small everyday task that'll get me thinking about coding.

I thought I'd keep track of what I learned every day with each set of puzzles, since I'm coming from a non-programmer background. I know some hardware Arduino/PIC C and have some vague R knowledge. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is I probably am using a lot of terms incorrectly and my code is probably a mess but hey, I'm trying.

## Day 1

* Python doesn't use ++
* Opening files and converting them into the data structure I want is weird
* Brute force is still an effective way to solve problems if you have time and patience

## Day 2

* How to merge a pull request - but probably no one should let me manage code repositories
* Figured out dicts sorta
* Found out Python can iterate over characters in strings!

## Day 3

* I put things into a pandas dataframe for practice mostly
* Iterating over it is probably the wrong way to do things (or at least an inefficient way) but it got the job done
* This didn't make a difference but thinking in a coordinate system that isn't like x goes up towards the right and y goes up towards the up is really weird
* Also, files that have weird delimiters are like why would you do this, but I guess they're more human-readable

## Day 4

* I HATE DATETIMES
* no seriously, why is it so difficult to subtract datetimes from one another
* also why is it difficult to convert datetime to an int

## Day 5

* learned about stacks!
* pop and append are kind of useful
* I probably didn't do it quite right but hey it works
* originally I was going to do something ridiculously nonsensically complicated for part 2 but then Dana set me onto a better path

## Day 6

* played with some numpy arrays to get used to them
* had more trouble with manhattan distance than anything else, once I got my head around the problem (order of operations is important - who knew!)
